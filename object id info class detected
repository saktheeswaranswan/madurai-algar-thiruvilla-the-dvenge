in this "                image_filename = f"{crop_counter[class_label]}.jpg"
" wil the id given be saved as imaje croped jpg file

ChatGPT
No, in the line image_filename = f"{crop_counter[class_label]}.jpg", the crop_counter[class_label] is used as the filename for the cropped image. It does not include the unique ID assigned to the object.

To include the unique ID in the image filename, you can modify the line to:

python
Copy code
image_filename = f"{object_id}_{crop_counter[class_label]}.jpg"
This will generate the image filename using the object_id followed by the crop_counter[class_label].
